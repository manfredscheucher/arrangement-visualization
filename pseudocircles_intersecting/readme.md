This is a visuation script for arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles
as described in our article (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-020-00173-4)[Arrangements of Pseudocircles: Triangles and Drawings].

Install (https://www.sagemath.org/)[SageMath] to run the scripts.

You can download the database of all intersecting arrangements for up to 6 pseudocircles 
and all digonfree intersecting arrangements for up to 7 pseudocircles from the
